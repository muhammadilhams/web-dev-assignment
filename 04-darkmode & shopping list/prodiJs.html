            <p class="lead fw-normal ">Computer Science Study Program is an assignment study program by
                the
                Directorate General of Higher Education, Ministry of Education and Culture based on Number 148 /
                E.E2 / DT / 2014 on Assignment of Study Program Implementation. The assignment letter was followed
                up by the Head of Hasanuddin University by answering the willingness to accept the assignment.
                Furthermore, the University Leadership through the Vice Rector for Academic Affairs assigned to the
                Department of Mathematics to prepare all the completeness of the application of the study program,
                especially the KKNI-Based Curriculum in accordance with Presidential Regulation No. 8 of 2012. After
                all the requirements were declared complete and feasible for the opening of a new study program, the
                Directorate General of The Ministry of Education issued Decree No. 163 / E / O / 2014 dated June 10,
                2014 concerning the Permit for the Implementation of Computer Science Study Program. Computer
                Science Study Program is the 3rd Study Program managed by the Department of Mathematics which
                previously had a Mathematics Study Program and Statistics Study Program. Furthermore, to manage the
                study program, the appointment of Dr. Armin Lawi, M.Eng was carried out. as Chairman of the Computer
                Science Study Program by the Rector of Hasanuddin University based on the Decree of the Rector of
                Hasanuddin University Number 27570 / UN4 / KP.04 / 2014.

                After all the completeness as a Study Program, Hasanuddin University opened the registration of
                prospective new students in the academic year 2014/2015 through an independent path with the number
                of interests as many as 1858 people and was declared to pass the selection as many as 65 people, but
                who re-registered as many as 61 people. For this first generation using the Higher Education
                Curriculum (KPT) 2014-2018 has received approval in the Senate of the Faculty of Mathematics and
                Natural Science Hasanuddin University although there are still some subjects that need to be
                equipped with RPS and Teaching Materials. To complement the RPS and Teaching Materials, the Computer
                Science Study Program conducted workshops and curriculum workshops through the Study Program
                Capacity Development Program (PKPS) in 2015 and 2016 with the achievement of all courses having RPS
                and Teaching Materials.

                Then in 2017 Hasanuddin University through the Institute of Quality Assurance and Educational
                Development (LPMPP) organized the Alignment of Ouput Based Education (OBE) Based Curriculum
                throughout hasanuddin University study programs. The result of this activity is the Higher Education
                Curriculum (KPT) 2018-2022 which has been established by decree of the Rector of Hasanuddin
                University No. 3923 / UN4.1 / KEP / 2020. The KPT began to be implemented in the Gasal Semester of
                the Academic Year 2018/2019. The number of active students of the Computer Science Study Program in
                the gasal semester 2020/2021 was 312 people.

                In 2018 PS ILKOM applied for accreditation for the first time to BAN-PT and obtained Accreditation
                B, based on BAN-PT Accreditation Decree No.3475/ SK/BAN-PT/Akred/S/XII/2018. After the issuance of
                the accreditation decree, the Computer Science Study Program has graduated as many as 103 people
                until June 2021.

                Then on the advice and opinion of the Directorate of Higher Education and the Association of Higher
                Education Informatics and Computers that the nomeclature of Computer Science is the same as
                Informatics / Informatics Engineering so that Hasanuddin University is asked to organize a study
                program because at Hasanuddin University there is a Study Program in Informatics Engineering and
                Computer Science. Therefore, Hasanuddin University took the policy that Computer Science changed its
                name to the Information Systems Study Program with the consideration that Informatics Engineering
                first existed at Hasanuddin University with a large number of students. The name change has been
                approved by the Rector with the issuance of the Decree of the Rector of Hasanuddin University Number
                452 / UN4.1 / KEP / 2021 after receiving recommendations from the Senate of the Faculty of
                Mathematics and Natural Science and Commission I of the Academic Senate of Hasanuddin University.
                With the change in the name of the study program, it is necessary to adjust KPT 2018 by substituting
                several Computer Science subjects with the core subjects of Information Systems in accordance with
                the Curriculum Development Guidelines Based on OBE In The Field of Informatics and Computers.

                Based on the above, Information Systems Study Program has held an Information System webinar on
                February 13, 2021 with speakers from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology
                represented by the Director General of Higher Education, Chairman of APTIKOM, and Rector of Pradita
                University Jakarta. This webinar was attended by all universities in the field of Informatics and
                Computers, Leaders of Mathematics, Head of Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Science, Lecturers,
                Students, and stakeholders both from government institutions and from the private sector. This
                webinar is the beginning of the KPT 2018 change process followed by FGD in a planned manner
                involving the Dean, Vice Dean, GPM, Department Chairman, Prodi Chairman, lecturer, tendik, and
                Information Systems Study Program students. The results of the FGD in the form of Draft KPT
                2021-2025 which has received senate recommendations and KPT 2021-2025 will be lent in the Gasal
                Semester 2021/2022.</p>
